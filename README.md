Consortium News is the podcast for <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/">Consortiumnews.com</a>, a home for important, well-reported stories that challenge the dominant mainstream news media of our day. We focus on international and domestic policies, as well as political and media developments in the United States and abroad.  Consortium News was founded in 1995 as the first investigative news magazine on the internet by Robert Parry, one of the reporters who helped expose the Iran-Contra scandal for The Associated Press in the mid-1980s. Funded through small donations from readers, Consortium News is not beholden to any government or corporate special interests<br>
